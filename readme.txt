This is the final game submission of group 6:
Qihao HE qheag@connect.ust.hk
Hantao ZHENG hzhengal@connect.ust.hk

The executable is under Game folder, if errors like vcruntime not found occur, try installing VC_redist.x64.exe.
It takes about 40s to initialize in-game resources and generate all the vegetations so please be patient.

If any other problem occurs(most likely to be dll not found), please contact hzhengal@connect.ust.hk, sorry for the inconvenience caused.

To review the code, open the Project.sln under the root folder, press F5 to compile and run the code,
please contact me if any dependency missing or any other problem occurs.

How to play:
wasd to control the camera perspective
direction buttons to move your character
L to attack
P to shield
left shift to dash
right shift to reset everything

Hope you enjoy the game!
